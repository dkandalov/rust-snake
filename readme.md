### What is this?
This is a minimal [snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) 
with [ncurses UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) written in Rust.
It is an attempt to re-implement of [Kotlin/Native snake](https://github.com/dkandalov/kotlin-native-snake) in Rust,
therefore, some design decisions might not be idiomatic. 

### How to use?
 - make sure Rust and [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/) are installed
 - see `makefile` to execute targets from it
